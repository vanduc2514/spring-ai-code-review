You are building an automated code review tool for the Engineering department of a technology/software company. 

Develop a tool that can analyze the codebase and identify security vulnerabilities.
Detect common security risks: 
- such as SQL injection, 
- cross-site scripting (XSS),
- authentication flaws, or 
- insecure data handling. 

Provide recommendations and best practices to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the codebase follows secure coding practices.
